# Project 1 - Portfolio


## Getting Started

This project can be deployed by either following this link: https://jasonstreet.github.io/project-1-portfolio/
OR
By downloading all of the files as a zip and opening as a project in Brackets (other IDE's should work but results may differ)

## Testing

This website has been tested on Vivaldi, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. I have tested the responsiveness of the website by re-sizing it, and all the elements fit to the screen when shrunk or enlarged. The JavaScript also works on multiple browsers without any noticable errors.

### Goals

I think the original goal I had in mind was realistic with regards to the speification provided for the module as well as my own skills as a developer. The project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript and collates them in an easy to use and view portfolio. Not only does the portfolio act as a gateway tp other standalone projects, but acts as a showcase in itself of multiple front-end techonlogies. I think that this website achieves the aims that I started with, namely to build a nice looking and functional portfolio.

I enjoyed using CodePen and implementing animations, functions and styles that I found. It was a challenge to import the code into my own website, as the code was always incompatible when simply copy and pasted into my own project. I had to repeatedly test and alter code so that it worked with my own code. Testing was very simple and I was able to use Brackets IDE's inbuilt browser to quickly test my code.

However there are certain things that I could have done differently, in order to improve the overall design of the project. I looked into implementing a page pre-loader, as the web pages does take between roughly 0.5-1 seconds to load, during which time the images flicker into view. I did look into implementing a landing page, and while it was visually appealing, it ultimately had no affect on the load time of my actual portfolio, as the web page did not load until a user actually went into it. I did look into dedicated tools for pre-loading, however I struggled to implement them successfully, and ended up leaving the page as is.

I made a lot of changes to this project over time. At one point, I had left a lot of redundant files in the project, such as javascript files for animations and functions that were no longer used. It was pointed out to me that I should removed these files to reduce the clutter/size of the project. I have left some commented code in my project files however, as I consider them to be helpful and provide insight into how some of the more complicated bits of Javascript work.
