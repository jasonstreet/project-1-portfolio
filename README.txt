Project 1 - Front-end focused Portfolio

This project contains the following files:

css
js
portfolio
scss
index.html
license.txt
README.txt
style.sass

This project can be deployed by either following this link: https://jasonstreet.github.io/project-1-portfolio/
OR
By downloading all of the files as a zip and opening as a project in Brackets (other IDE's should work but results may differ)

This project is made using a bootsrap template as a base, along with HTML, Javascript and CSS written by me, along with features from Codepen.io, mostly SASS and advanced Javascript.

This portfolio was created to server two main purposes, the first being a project itself, similar to the one demonstrated in a previous lesson, and the  second being to server as a CV/Portfolio for myself in the future.
