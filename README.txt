Project 1 - Front-end focused Portfolio

------------------------------------------DEPLOYMENT------------------------------------------

This project can be deployed by either following this link: https://jasonstreet.github.io/project-1-portfolio/
OR
By downloading all of the files as a zip and opening as a project in Brackets (other IDE's should work but results may differ)

------------------------------------------BRIEFING------------------------------------------

This project is made using a bootsrap template as a base, along with HTML, PHP, Javascript and CSS written by me, along with features from Codepen.io, mostly SASS and Jquery items, such as the folding profile picture, type writing text and sweetJS(javascript alerts replacer)

This portfolio was created to server two main purposes, the first being a project itself, similar to the one demonstrated in a previous lesson, and the  second being to serve as a CV/Portfolio for myself in the future.

------------------------------------------OVERVIEW------------------------------------------

I think the original goal I had in mind was realistic with regards to the speification provided for the module as well as my own skills as a developer. The project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript and collates them in an easy to use and view portfolio. Not only does the portfolio act as a gateway tp other standalone projects, but acts as a showcase in itself of multiple front-end techonlogies. I think that this website achieves the aims that I started with, namely to build a nice looking and functional portfolio.

I enjoyed using CodePen and implementing animations, functions and styles that I found. It was a challenge to import the code into my own website, as the code was always incompatible when simply copy and pasted into my own project. I had to repeatedly test and alter code so that it worked with my own code. Testing was very simple and I was able to use Brackets IDE's inbuilt browser to quickly test my code.

However there are certain things that I could have done differently, in order to improve the overall design of the project. I looked into implementing a page pre-loader, as the web pages does take between roughly 0.5-1 seconds to load, during which time the images flicker into view. I did look into implementing a landing page, and while it was visually appealing, it ultimately had no affect on the load time of my actual portfolio, as the web page did not load until a user actually went into it. I did look into dedicated tools for pre-loading, however I struggled to implement them successfully, and ended up leaving the page as is.

I made a lot of changes to this project over time. At one point, I had left a lot of redundant files in the project, such as javascript files for animations and functions that were no longer used. It was pointed out to me that I should removed these files to reduce the clutter/size of the project. I have left some commented code in my project files however, as I consider them to be helpful and provide insight into how some of the more complicated bits of Javascript work.
