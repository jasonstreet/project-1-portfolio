Project 1 - Front-end focused Portfolio

This project contains the following files:

css
js
portfolio
scss
index.html
license.txt
README.txt
style.sass

The project is also in a ZIP format (httpd.www.zip)

This project is made using a bootsrap template as a base, along with HTML, Javascript and CSS written by me, along with features from Codepen.io, mostly
SASS and advanced Javascript.

This portfolio was created to server two main purposes, the first being a project itself, similar to the one demonstrated in a previous lesson, and the 
second being to server as a CV/Portfolio for myself in the future.

My project can also be found on my github. Note that some assessets include on Github may not be included or are heavily modified in the final version.



Project 1 - Portfolio is the final version
